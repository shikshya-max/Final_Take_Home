# ARC AGI 2025 Challenge – Symbolic AI Task Solutions

This repository contains symbolic solutions for select tasks from the **ARC AGI 2025 Challenge**. All models and logic were implemented **without any neural networks**, relying entirely on **explicit rules**, **pattern reasoning**, and **symbolic transformation**.

---

## General Approach

We adopted a **pure symbolic AI** framework for all tasks. This means:

- No learning or backpropagation was involved.
- The system uses deterministic rules derived from example input-output pairs.
- Every decision is **transparent**, **explainable**, and **reproducible**.

## Tasks and Solutions

### Problem 1: Path Inference on Grid

- **Objective**: Connect source (2) → junction (4) → destination (3) using a path (5) on a 13x13 grid.
- **Method**: Axis-priority path drawing based on symbolic direction inference.
- **Key Features**:
  - Inferred axis order (horizontal → vertical or vice versa) from the first example.
  - Avoids overwriting object cells.
  - Rule-based path traversal.
- **Pros**: Fast, interpretable, and deterministic.

### Problem 2: Abstract Block Stacking

- **Objective**: Reconstruct output grid by learning block stacking logic from input.
- **Method**: Analyze discrete blocks and infer dominant layout pattern (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).
- **Key Features**:
  - Blocks sorted and placed by symbolic layout operators.
  - Learned stacking rule applied to all test examples.
  - Deterministic, shape- and color-aware block manipulation.

### Problem 3: Denoising via Template Matching

- **Objective**: Restore corrupted grid based on clean training references.
- **Method**: Tile extraction and fuzzy template matching.
- **Key Features**:
  - Symbolic tile library creation from clean grids.
  - Sliding window with similarity checks to repair noisy input.
  - Denoised grid is generated by replacing noisy regions with best-matching templates.

---

## Evaluation

- **Metrics**:
  - Exact match with output grid.
  - Path fidelity and block placement accuracy.
  - Tile recovery score for denoising.
- **Training**: One-shot rule learning from training examples; no iterative optimization.
- **Augmentation**: Not required but possible via rotation, recoloring, or synthetic noise.

## Justification for Symbolic AI

- Fully interpretable, deterministic logic.
- No need for large datasets.
- Well-suited for rule-based, grid-centric reasoning tasks.
- Avoids the opacity and unpredictability of neural models.
